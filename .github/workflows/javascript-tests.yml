# This workflow will do a clean installation of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-nodejs

name: JavaScript tests (Jest)
# This CI workflow uses Jest, which runs in a Node.js environment, to test the JavaScript code.
# Jest allows JavaScript modules to be loaded and tested in isolation.
# By contrast, the Playwright CI workflow uses Playwright, which loads the entire app in the browser and simulates user interactions.
